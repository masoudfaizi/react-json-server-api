# react-json-server-api
In this web project we used react as fronted and JSON Server as Node module to create REST JSON services as storing the data as JSON format

Here We have two parts, **frontend** and **backend**. 

In frontend I have used ReactJS, with many functionality as below:

1. **Semantic-ui** for design material and added its CDN in index.html file inside the frontend->public.
2. **Validation from**, I have used from useForm hook to validate the search form's inputs.
3. **Pagination**, I have created a custom component for pagination to do pagination in table.

For backend I used the json-server as to store the given data object in JSON format file and then creating the REST JSON service to handle the request from the client (frontend).

To run the project, first need to download the repository and then explore to each of two folder 'frontend' and 'server-api' and run both these command in both directories:

```
npm install 

npm start

```
